  (*
    Function for performing lambda calculus substitutions.
    We denote subsitutions as M[x := P], which is read as:
    replace every "free" x in M with P. A free variable is one that is not bound
    by an abstraction.

    The arguments are (in order):
      - var: the name of the variable you want to substitute for
      - target: the term that you substitute for said variable
      - t: the term you want to perform the substitution on

  (*
    Auxiliary function to check whether a term is a beta-redex,
    basically a term of form (位x.M)P which, by beta-reduction,
    we treat as nothing else than function application, thus
    (位x.M)P -> M[x := P] (substitute x in M for P).
  *)
  let is_beta_redex (t: term) : bool =
    match t with
      | App (Abs (_, _), _) -> true
      | _ -> false

  (*
    This function performs a single step of the normalizing
    leftmost reduction strategy on term t and returns the result
    along with the information whether any redex has been reduced.

    As a result of the standariztion theorem, repeatedly applying
    this function until no changes are made yields 
    the normal form of the term t (if one exists).

    But beware: the problem of finding whether an untyped lambda calculus term
    has a normal form is undecideable (belongs to RE but not to CORE).

    Therefore repeatedly applying this function is not always a good idea
    since the term might not have a normal form and the program would run forever.
    It's suggested to put an upper limit on the number of reductions you allow.

    And no, there is no "universal" limit that you can calculate based on
    size of the term. This is closely related to the undecideable problem of
    whether a program is a "busy beaver champion".
    For more information, look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver

    This function takes a single argument: the term t that you want to perform
    the reduction on.

  (*
    Function that attempts to normalize a term using
    the leftmost reduction strategy, but limiting
    the number of beta-reductions to max_steps to avoid endless reductions
    on terms without a normal form.

      - max_steps: the maximum number of reductions
      - t: the term you want to normalize

    The function returns:
      - Normalized term - if the function managed to normalize the given term,
        then "term" holds the normal form of t
      - NotNormalized term - if the function failed to normalize the given term,
